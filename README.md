# Noorani-Qaeda-by-Speech-Recognition
This project basically is an attempt to learn Noorani Qaeda using Deep learning. Currently we are using this CNN for audio classification.
https://github.com/drscotthawley/audio-classifier-keras-cnn

# Dependencies
We are currently using python 3 to setup this project. Other libraries included are :
1) numpy
2) librosa
3) shutil
4) os
5) keras
6) pyaudio
7) wave
8) requests
9) time
10) json

# Dataset
We have a dataset of 3080 audios belonging to 28 classes. Classes included are given below.

'qaaf', 'sa', 'seen', 'zal', 'jeem', 'sheen', 'ba', 'zuaa', 'meem', 'suad', 'noon', 'tuaa', 'ta', 'yaa'
'raa', 'zaa', 'kaaf', 'kha', 'ayn', 'ha', 'laam', 'waaw', 'haaa', 'zuad', 'ghayn', 'dal', 'alif', 'faa'

Out of these 3080 audios, 2743 are artificially generated by increasing and decreasing the sample rate of audios.

# Preprocessing
We did 2 types of prerocessing:
1) Silence Removal
2) Noise Removal

We achieved this task by using SOX library.

Some results are :

# Results
Currently it is not fully trained. But ar present it is giving 87% accuracy on validation data.

# How to use Current Trained Model
Put your .wav files in Samples folder and then run the test_network.py script.

# Future Work
We are at present working on getting some more real world data rather than generate artificial data. Once we achieve a high accuracy on this, we are aiming to cover the whole noorani qaeda and then maybe the shorh duas as well.
